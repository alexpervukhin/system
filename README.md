# Building Lift System Simulation

Building Lift System Simulation, supports any number of lifts and floors. 
Implements resource-intensive service strategy but can be tweaked to support more,
for example resource saving strategy (less lifts in transit, more stops per lift). 

## Getting Started

need: Java 8+, Maven 3+;

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
